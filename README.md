# Email Verifier

**Email Verifier** is a tool designed to validate email addresses and check their deliverability. It ensures that the email addresses in your list are **valid, correctly formatted, and capable of receiving emails**, reducing bounce rates and improving the overall quality of your email communication.

## Features
- **Format Validation**: Verifies if the email address follows the correct syntax (e.g., `user@example.com`).
- **MX Records Check**: Confirms that the email domain has valid Mail Exchange (MX) records for email reception.
- **SMTP Check**: Ensures that the email server accepts incoming emails for the provided email address.
- **Catch-All Check**: Identifies if the domain accepts all emails, even if the specific address doesn't exist.
- **Disposable Email Detection**: Flags temporary or disposable email addresses commonly used for short-term or spam purposes.
- **Role Address Detection**: Identifies role-based addresses (like `support@`, `info@`, etc.), often used by businesses.

## Usage

**Email Verifier** allows you to check a single email or multiple email addresses at once. Here‚Äôs how to use the tool:

### 1. **First Input Field**: **Valid Email Address**
- Enter a valid email address in the first field. This is needed because some email providers check for **real connections** before accepting emails.

### 2. **Second Input Field**: **Port**
- Enter the port number for the SMTP server (the default port is **25**). You can specify any port you need to connect to the email server.

### 3. **Third Input Field**: **Email Check/Verifier**
- This field allows you to check one or multiple email addresses. You can enter a **single email** or **bulk email addresses**, separated by a newline.

### Example of Response Results:

When you check an email or multiple emails, the response will look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "email": "info@domain.com",
    "format_valid": true,
    "mx_found": true,
    "smtp_check": true,
    "catch_all": true,
    "role": true,
    "disposable": false
  },
  {
    "email": "contact@example.com",
    "format_valid": true,
    "mx_found": true,
    "smtp_check": true,
    "catch_all": true,
    "role": true,
    "disposable": false
  }
]
```

This JSON response provides details about each email's validation, including whether it is:
- **format_valid**: Whether the email is correctly formatted.
- **mx_found**: Whether the domain has valid MX records.
- **smtp_check**: Whether the email server accepts the address.
- **catch_all**: Whether the domain accepts all emails, even if the specific address doesn‚Äôt exist.
- **role**: Whether the email is a role-based address (e.g., `support@`).
- **disposable**: Whether the email address is from a disposable provider.
